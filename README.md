This repo is a sample layout using sanity as a CMS with Tailwind. Some common features of a CMS include the ability to create, edit, and publish web pages, manage media files such as images and videos, and handle website navigation and structure. A CMS typically has a backend interface, accessed by content authors and administrators, and a frontend interface that visitors to the website interact with.
